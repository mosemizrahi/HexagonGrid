Red Vertex: Vertex on fire

Green Vertex: Vertex protected by a firefighter.

Left click a non-burning, non-protected vertex to protect it with a firefighter.

You can hold down the mouse buttons to protect multiple vertices.

Press the right arrow key to make the fire spread automatically. If necessary, the grid will grow to accomodate the fire spread.

Press the left arrow key to undo events. An event is a turn of fire spreading (with at least one new fire), or the placement of a new fire or firefighter on the grid. You can undo multiple events by pressing left repeatedly.

Press G to make the grid grow.

Press R to reset the grid.
